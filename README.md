# 3D_scene

When I design software, I usually start by thinking about what the user needs and what the end goal is. For this OpenGL project, I wanted to create a scene that felt real and familiar, so I went with a basic desk setup. That helped guide the choices I made for objects and textures. Breaking things down into smaller steps also helped me stay organized and focus on one piece at a time.

While working on this, I picked up some new design skills. One of the big ones was learning how to use custom functions to manage things like lighting and materials. For example, I created a function that sets how each object reacts to light, which made my code cleaner and easier to work with. I also got better at using textures to make the scene feel more realistic.

My design process was pretty simple. I planned out the scene, figured out which shapes I needed, added textures, and then kept testing to make sure everything looked right. I tried to improve things as I went along. That kind of step-by-step approach helped me stay on track and make steady progress.

These same tactics—planning first, breaking things into parts, and using reusable functions—are definitely things I can use in future projects. They make coding a lot more manageable and less overwhelming.

When I write code, I usually start small and build up from there. I test things often so I can catch mistakes early. With this project, I had to try a few different ways to handle lighting and camera movement before finding what worked. It took some trial and error, but that’s all part of the process.

Each milestone helped me improve. I started thinking more about how to reuse code and keep things organized. I also got more comfortable working with OpenGL and understanding how the scene gets rendered.

Studying computer science and doing projects like this really helps me get closer to my goals. It gives me hands-on experience and builds up my skills in a way that’s actually useful.

Learning about 3D graphics also gave me a better sense of how visual tools work. These skills will help me in the future, whether I’m working on apps, games, or data visualizations. It’s also made me think more visually, which is something I can apply in both school and future jobs.
